This is an AI enabled tool to deconstruct and analyze Audio files. 
Using AI, the audio is converted Into its individual stems. then these stamps are passed into different ai processors, Resulting in second layer of information.
for example the vocals is passed through Whisper speech to text engine. and subtitles are generated for the track.
Similarly the rhythm Stem is passed through chords detector and the chords are generated for the track. 
This kind of Deconstructor can be helpful to understand the content of a media file whether it be video or audio translation capabilities can help art driver's language boundaries it can also help students learn languages.

 you might consider names like "Audio Deconstructor Pro," "StemSight," "SonicAI Analyzer," "Aural Insight," or "EchoLysis." Names are often chosen to reflect the function and sophistication of the software while also being catchy and easy to remember.

Shortened, it can be called 

"ADP" (for Audio Deconstructor Pro), "StemScope," "SonicAlyz," "AurIn," or "EchoLyzer." These shortened names maintain a connection to the original, longer names while being more succinct and easier to brand or mention in conversation. They are designed to be memorable and give a quick hint at the software's capabilities. Okay I like Aurin
